# Site to RSS feed

The goal of the project is the create a simple Website to RSS feed service.

Create a web app where a user can manage (add/edit/delete) site feeds.

Pay attention to the feed creation UX and make it as easy as possible for the
user to create a feed.

Once the user adds a website URL, you will try yo automatically analyze a
website and build the RSS feed. Using an LLM for this task is allowed.

If that succeeds, show the RSS Feed and the mapping of on-page elements that
were used to map to relevant feed values (title, url, content, date, author).
User should be able to edit these and see changes in real time.

If this fails, show the website in an interface where the user can point and
click to select elements.

The acceptance criteria is that the user can visit the service, and create feeds
for websites in an intuitive and as simple as possible manner.
